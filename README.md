# Inverted Pendulum Robot

## Project Overview

The Inverted Pendulum Robot is a two-wheeled robot that uses a control system to maintain an upright position and balance itself. This readme provides a brief overview of the project and instructions on how to set up and run the robot.

## Hardware Requirements

To build and run the Inverted Pendulum Robot, you will need the following hardware components:

- Microcontroller board (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi Pico)
- Stepper Motor drivers for controlling the robot's motors
- Two stepper motors for driving
- IMU sensor (Inertial Measurement Unit) for measuring tilt angles and acceleration
- Power supply
- Chassis or frame for mounting the components
- Connecting wires

Please note that the specific hardware requirements may vary depending on the design and implementation choices.

## Software Requirements

The software requirements for the Inverted Pendulum Robot project are as follows:

- Arduino IDE or any suitable programming environment for the microcontroller
- Any additional software tools or libraries required for communication or visualization (optional)

## Setup and Configuration

Follow these steps to set up and configure the Inverted Pendulum Robot:

1. Assemble the hardware components according to your design. Attach the motors to the wheels and mount them securely on the chassis or frame.
2. Connect the motors and IMU sensor to the microcontroller board using the appropriate wiring.
3. Install the necessary libraries for motor control and sensor data processing in your programming environment.
4. Write or upload the control algorithm code to the microcontroller board using the Arduino IDE or similar software.
5. Ensure that the power supply is connected and providing sufficient power to the motors and microcontroller.
6. Double-check all the connections and ensure that everything is securely connected.

## Running the Robot

To run the Inverted Pendulum Robot, follow these steps:

1. Power on the robot by connecting the power supply.
2. The control algorithm should start running automatically. The IMU sensor will measure the tilt angles, and the control algorithm will adjust the motors to maintain balance.
3. Observe the robot as it attempts to balance itself. It may take some time for the robot to stabilize and find its balance.
4. You can monitor the behavior of the robot using a serial monitor or any visualization tool you have set up.
5. To stop the robot, simply disconnect the power supply.

## Further Customization and Improvements

The Inverted Pendulum Robot project offers many opportunities for customization and improvement. Here are some ideas to explore:

- Implement different control algorithms, such as PID, LQR, or Kalman filters, and compare their performance.
- Add additional sensors, such as encoders or distance sensors, for more precise measurements and obstacle avoidance capabilities.
- Develop a wireless control interface to adjust the control parameters or control the robot remotely.
- Enhance the robot's stability by incorporating feedback from additional sensors or by modifying the chassis design.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the project to enhance your understanding of control systems and robotics.

## Conclusion

The Inverted Pendulum Robot project is an exciting venture into the world of balancing robots and control systems. By following the instructions in this readme, you can build, set up, and run your own Inverted Pendulum Robot.
